# mPower-features

This folder contains the features tested for mPower analysis across voice and tremor

To Run most of the test_* functions you will need a few companion functions (unwrapjson, unwrapjsonall, unwrapfilepmap), which are also present in the folder essential-scripts. You also need to install JSONLab (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files)
